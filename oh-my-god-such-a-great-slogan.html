              Rabota.ua, Ukraine's largest job search platform with over 4M monthly users, shifted 
              its positioning from presenting dry job and candidate statistics to creating an emotionally 
              driven <strong>Website for finding opportunities</strong>. 
              <p>
              My task was to help the company motivate people through a slogan, encouraging them 
              to look for career opportunities that would lead to a happy life, rather than just for a survival job.

                  For the rebranding launch, I proposed the campaign slogan <strong>"Why not you?"</strong>.
                  The essence of this message is that every day, thousands of Ukrainians improve 
                  their lives through opportunities they find on Rabota.ua. So, why it's someone else, but not you?
